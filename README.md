The only parameter for the interrupt is ah, ah=0 is for register values, and ah=1 is for stack values. domaci1.asm -stop will stop the TSR program. Additionally, domaci1.asm -peek aabb ccdd will show the value of the byte located on address [aabb:ccdd] (aa is hex number). domaci1.asm -poke byte aabb ccdd ee will set the value at address [aabb:ccdd] to the byte ee.
